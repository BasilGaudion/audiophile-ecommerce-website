# Audiophile E-Commerce Website

![Design preview for the Audiophile e-commerce website](./preview.jpg)

## Introduction 🎉

Welcome to my Audiophile E-Commerce Website project! This project was built as a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). It is a multi-page, fully responsive e-commerce website. This was an incredible opportunity to improve my coding skills by building something that closely resembles a real-world project. This website has been developed in mobile first.

## Technologies Used 💻

- React.js
- HTML5
- SASS
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Features 🛍

Users visiting the website can:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- Experience hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Add and remove products from the cart.
- Edit product quantities in the cart.
- Fill in all fields in the checkout.
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout.
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart. Shipping always adds $50 to the order and VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping.
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary.
- **Bonus**: The cart's state is preserved even after the browser is refreshed using `localStorage`.
